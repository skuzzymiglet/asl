        ## The Auto Screen-lapse Tool
        
        ### Introduction
        
        asl is a resource-inexpensive way to create timelapses from your screen. It takes screenshots at intervals (`asl`) and uses ffmpeg to convert them into a video (`asl-timelapse`), optionally archiving them
        
        ### Installation
        
        Just `pip install asl_screenlapse`
        
        ### How to use
        
        Daemonization is flexible. Run `asl` at bootup, with DE Autostart, WM config, systemd service, etc. It will take screenshots in `$HOME/asl-scrots` at intervals, but if more than a certain time passes between them (i.e. different boot), it will create a new numbered folder. 
        
        Whenever you want, run `asl-timelapse` to create timelapses in `$HOME/asl-summaries`, named according to folder number and in the WEBM format.
        
        ### Example output
        
        ![example](asl-example.gif)
        
        See also `asl-example.webm`
        
        ### Quirks
        
        + The non-`pip` dependency of `ffmpeg`, with no way to specify it in `setup.py`
        + The usage of `os.system()`
        + The `ffmpeg` command being written for Linux, so it doesn't work on Windows
        
        
        ### Todo
        
         - [X] Install scripts
         - [ ] Configuration in .ini format
         - [X] Make it available on the PyPI
         - [ ] Cross platform - using ffmpeg bindings rather than `os.system()`
         - [ ] AUR Package
         - [ ] Automatic archive zipping 
         - [ ] Timelapse from archive
